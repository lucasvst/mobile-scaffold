# Mobile Scaffold

Scaffold an empty Ionic application, ready to develop.

> npm install -g cordova ionic

> npm install

You are ready to develop.
Gulp will watch your src/ directory and merge your updates into www/.

In another tab:

Plus:

You can emulate the application in your device:

> ionic run android
